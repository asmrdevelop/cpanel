<p>


The first part of the run time configuration file contains three types of item:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
Macro definitions: These lines start with an upper case letter. See section
<a href="ch06.html#SECTmacrodefs" title="6. The Exim run time configuration file">6.4</a> for details of macro processing.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Named list definitions: These lines start with one of the words “domainlist”,
“hostlist”, “addresslist”, or “localpartlist”. Their use is described in
section <a href="ch10.html#SECTnamedlists" title="10. Domain, host, address, and local part lists">10.5</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Main configuration settings: Each setting occupies one line of the file
(with possible continuations). If any setting is preceded by the word
“hide”, the <span class="docbook_option">-bP</span> command line option displays its value to admin users
only. See section <a href="ch06.html#SECTcos" title="6. The Exim run time configuration file">6.10</a> for a description of the syntax of these option
settings.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
This chapter specifies all the main configuration options, along with their
types and default values. For ease of finding a particular option, they appear
in alphabetical order in section <a href="ch14.html#SECTalomo" title="14. Main configuration">14.23</a> below. However, because there
are now so many options, they are first listed briefly in functional groups, as
an aid to finding the name of the option you are looking for. Some options are
listed in more than one group.

This option causes Exim to send 8BITMIME in its response to an SMTP
EHLO command, and to accept the BODY= parameter on MAIL commands.
However, though Exim is 8-bit clean, it is not a protocol converter, and it
takes no steps to do anything special with messages received by this route.
</p>
<p class="changed">
Historically Exim kept this option off by default, but the maintainers
feel that in today’s Internet, this causes more problems than it solves.
It now defaults to true.

This option is expanded just once, at the start of Exim’s processing. If the
current group or any of the supplementary groups of an Exim caller is in this
colon-separated list, the caller has admin privileges. If all your system
programmers are in a specific group, for example, you can give them all Exim
admin privileges by putting that group in <span class="docbook_option">admin_groups</span>. However, this does
not permit them to read Exim’s spool files (whose group owner is the Exim gid).
To permit this, you have to add individuals to the Exim group.

If this option is set, the RFC 2822 domain literal format is permitted in
email addresses. The option is not set by default, because the domain literal
format is not normally required these days, and few people know about it. It
has, however, been exploited by mail abusers.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, it seems that some DNS black list maintainers are using this
format to report black listing to postmasters. If you want to accept messages
addressed to your hosts by IP address, you need to set
<span class="docbook_option">allow_domain_literals</span> true, and also to add <code class="docbook_literal">@[]</code> to the list of local
domains (defined in the named domain list <span class="docbook_option">local_domains</span> in the default
configuration). This “magic string” matches the domain literal form of all
the local host’s IP addresses.

<p>

It appears that more and more DNS zone administrators are breaking the rules
and putting domain names that look like IP addresses on the right hand side of
MX records. Exim follows the rules and rejects this, giving an error message
that explains the mis-configuration. However, some other MTAs support this
practice, so to avoid “Why can’t Exim do this?” complaints,
<span class="docbook_option">allow_mx_to_ip</span> exists, in order to enable this heinous activity. It is not
recommended, except when you have no other choice.

<p>


Lots of discussion is going on about internationalized domain names. One
camp is strongly in favour of just using UTF-8 characters, and it seems
that at least two other MTAs permit this. This option allows Exim users to
experiment if they wish.
</p>
<p>
If it is set true, Exim’s domain parsing function allows valid
UTF-8 multicharacters to appear in domain name components, in addition to
letters, digits, and hyphens. However, just setting this option is not
enough; if you want to look up these domain names in the DNS, you must also
adjust the value of <span class="docbook_option">dns_check_names_pattern</span> to match the extended form. A
suitable setting is:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
dns_check_names_pattern = (?i)^(?&gt;(?(1)\.|())[a-z0-9\xc0-\xff]\
  (?&gt;[-a-z0-9\x80-\xff]*[a-z0-9\x80-\xbf])?)+$
</pre></div>
<p>
Alternatively, you can just disable this feature by setting
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
dns_check_names_pattern =
</pre></div>
<p>
That is, set the option to an empty string so that no check is done.

</table>
<p>


If any server authentication mechanisms are configured, Exim advertises them in
response to an EHLO command only if the calling host matches this list.
Otherwise, Exim does not advertise AUTH.
Exim does not accept AUTH commands from clients to which it has not
advertised the availability of AUTH. The advertising of individual
authentication mechanisms can be controlled by the use of the
<span class="docbook_option">server_advertise_condition</span> generic authenticator option on the individual
authenticators. See chapter <a href="ch33.html" title="33. SMTP authentication">33</a> for further details.
</p>
<p>
Certain mail clients (for example, Netscape) require the user to provide a name
and password for authentication if AUTH is advertised, even though it may
not be needed (the host may accept messages from hosts on its local LAN without
authentication, for example). The <span class="docbook_option">auth_advertise_hosts</span> option can be used
to make these clients more friendly by excluding them from the set of hosts to
which Exim advertises AUTH.
</p>
<p>

If you want to advertise the availability of AUTH only when the connection
is encrypted using TLS, you can make use of the fact that the value of this
option is expanded, with a setting like this:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
auth_advertise_hosts = ${if eq{$tls_cipher}{}{}{*}}
</pre></div>
<p>

If $tls_cipher is empty, the session is not encrypted, and the result of
the expansion is empty, thus matching no hosts. Otherwise, the result of the
expansion is *, which matches all hosts.

If this option is set to a time greater than zero, a queue runner will try a
new delivery attempt on any frozen message, other than a bounce message, if

causes the entire message, both header and body, to be returned (subject to the
value of <span class="docbook_option">bounce_return_size_limit</span>). If this option is false, only the

This option sets a limit in bytes on the size of messages that are returned to
senders as part of bounce messages when <span class="docbook_option">bounce_return_message</span> is true. The
limit should be less than the value of the global <span class="docbook_option">message_size_limit</span> and of
any <span class="docbook_option">message_size_limit</span> settings on transports, to allow for the bounce text
that Exim generates. If this option is set to zero there is no limit.
</p>
<p>
When the body of any message that is to be included in a bounce message is
greater than the limit, it is truncated, and a comment pointing this out is
added at the top. The actual cutoff may be greater than the value given, owing
to the use of buffering for transferring the message in chunks (typically 8K in
size). The idea is to save bandwidth on those undeliverable 15-megabyte
messages.

RFC 2047 defines a way of encoding non-ASCII characters in headers using a
system of “encoded words”. The RFC specifies a maximum length for an encoded

exceed the maximum length. However, it seems that some software, in violation
of the RFC, generates overlong encoded words. If <span class="docbook_option">check_rfc2047_length</span> is

The four <span class="docbook_option">check_...</span> options allow for checking of disk resources before a
message is accepted.
</p>
<p>




When any of these options are set, they apply to all incoming messages. If you
want to apply different checks to different kinds of message, you can do so by
testing the variables $log_inodes, $log_space, $spool_inodes, and
$spool_space in an ACL with appropriate additional conditions.
</p>
<p>
<span class="docbook_option">check_spool_space</span> and <span class="docbook_option">check_spool_inodes</span> check the spool partition if
either value is greater than zero, for example:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
check_spool_space = 10M
check_spool_inodes = 100
</pre></div>
<p>
The spool partition is the one that contains the directory defined by
SPOOL_DIRECTORY in <span class="docbook_filename">Local/Makefile</span>. It is used for holding messages in
transit.
</p>
<p>
<span class="docbook_option">check_log_space</span> and <span class="docbook_option">check_log_inodes</span>  check the partition in which log
files are written if either is greater than zero. These should be set only if
<span class="docbook_option">log_file_path</span> and <span class="docbook_option">spool_directory</span> refer to different partitions.
</p>
<p>
If there is less space or fewer inodes than requested, Exim refuses to accept
incoming mail. In the case of SMTP input this is done by giving a 452 temporary
error response to the MAIL command. If ESMTP is in use and there was a
SIZE parameter on the MAIL command, its value is added to the
<span class="docbook_option">check_spool_space</span> value, and the check is performed even if
<span class="docbook_option">check_spool_space</span> is zero, unless <span class="docbook_option">no_smtp_check_spool_space</span> is set.
</p>
<p>
The values for <span class="docbook_option">check_spool_space</span> and <span class="docbook_option">check_log_space</span> are held as a
number of kilobytes. If a non-multiple of 1024 is specified, it is rounded up.
</p>
<p>
For non-SMTP input and for batched SMTP input, the test is done at start-up; on
failure a message is written to stderr and Exim exits with a non-zero code, as
it obviously cannot send an error message of any kind.

When a message is delayed, Exim sends a warning message to the sender at
intervals specified by this option. The data is a colon-separated list of times
after which to send warning messages. If the value of the option is an empty
string or a zero time, no warnings are sent. Up to 10 times may be given. If a
message has been on the queue for longer than the last time, the last interval
between the times is used to compute subsequent warning times. For example,
with
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
delay_warning = 4h:8h:24h
</pre></div>
<p>
the first message is sent after 4 hours, the second after 8 hours, and
the third one after 24 hours. After that, messages are sent every 16 hours,
because that is the interval between the last two times on the list. If you set
just one time, it specifies the repeat interval. For example, with:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
delay_warning = 6h
</pre></div>
<p>
messages are repeated every six hours. To stop warnings after a given time, set
a very large time at the end of the list. For example:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
delay_warning = 2h:12h:99d
</pre></div>
<p>

<p>

The string is expanded at the time a warning message might be sent. If all the
deferred addresses have the same domain, it is set in $domain during the
expansion. Otherwise $domain is empty. If the result of the expansion is a
forced failure, an empty string, or a string matching any of “0”, “no” or
“false” (the comparison being done caselessly) then the warning message is
not sent. The default is:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
delay_warning_condition = ${if or {\
  { !eq{$h_list-id:$h_list-post:$h_list-subscribe:}{} }\
  { match{$h_precedence:}{(?i)bulk|list|junk} }\
  { match{$h_auto-submitted:}{(?i)auto-generated|auto-replied} }\
  } {no}{yes}}
</pre></div>
<p>
This suppresses the sending of warnings for messages that contain <span class="docbook_emphasis">List-ID:</span>,
<span class="docbook_emphasis">List-Post:</span>, or <span class="docbook_emphasis">List-Subscribe:</span> headers, or have “bulk”, “list” or
“junk” in a <span class="docbook_emphasis">Precedence:</span> header, or have “auto-generated” or

If this option is set true, Exim drops its root privilege at the start of a
delivery process, and runs as the Exim user throughout. This severely restricts

DNS lookups give a “try again” response for the DNS errors
“non-authoritative host not found” and “SERVERFAIL”. This can cause Exim to
keep trying to deliver a message, or to give repeated temporary errors to
incoming mail. Sometimes the effect is caused by a badly set up name server and
may persist for a long time. If a domain which exhibits this problem matches
anything in <span class="docbook_option">dns_again_means_nonexist</span>, it is treated as if it did not exist.
This option should be used with care. You can make it apply to reverse lookups
by a setting such as this:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
dns_again_means_nonexist = *.in-addr.arpa
</pre></div>
<p>
This option applies to all DNS lookups that Exim does. It also applies when the
<span class="docbook_function">gethostbyname()</span> or <span class="docbook_function">getipnodebyname()</span> functions give temporary errors,
since these are most likely to be caused by DNS lookup problems. The
<span class="docbook_command">dnslookup</span> router has some options of its own for controlling what happens
when lookups for MX or SRV records give temporary errors. These more specific
options are applied after this global option.

When this option is set to a non-empty string, it causes Exim to check domain
names for characters that are not allowed in host names before handing them to
the DNS resolver, because some resolvers give temporary errors for names that
contain unusual characters. If a domain name contains any unwanted characters,
a “not found” result is forced, and the resolver is not called. The check is
done by matching the domain name against a regular expression, which is the
value of this option. The default pattern is
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
dns_check_names_pattern = \
  (?i)^(?&gt;(?(1)\.|())[^\W_](?&gt;[a-z0-9/-]*[^\W_])?)+$
</pre></div>
<p>
which permits only letters, digits, slashes, and hyphens in components, but
they must start and end with a letter or digit. Slashes are not, in fact,
permitted in host names, but they are found in certain NS records (which can be
accessed in Exim by using a <span class="docbook_option">dnsdb</span> lookup). If you set
<span class="docbook_option">allow_utf8_domains</span>, you must modify this pattern, or set the option to an
empty string.

Setting this option causes Exim to send bcc copies of bounce messages that it
generates to other addresses. <span class="docbook_emphasis">Note</span>: This does not apply to bounce messages
coming from elsewhere. The value of the option is a colon-separated list of
items. Each item consists of a pattern, terminated by white space, followed by
a comma-separated list of email addresses. If a pattern contains spaces, it
must be enclosed in double quotes.
</p>
<p>
Each pattern is processed in the same way as a single item in an address list
(see section <a href="ch10.html#SECTaddresslist" title="10. Domain, host, address, and local part lists">10.19</a>). When a pattern matches the recipient of
the bounce message, the message is copied to the addresses on the list. The
items are scanned in order, and once a matching one is found, no further items
are examined. For example:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
errors_copy = spqr@mydomain   postmaster@mydomain.example :\
              rqps@mydomain   hostmaster@mydomain.example,\
                              postmaster@mydomain.example
</pre></div>
<p>


The address list is expanded before use. The expansion variables $local_part
and $domain are set from the original recipient of the error message, and if
there was any wildcard matching in the pattern, the expansion

variables $0, $1, etc. are set in the normal way.

You should not set this option greater than zero if your user information is in

On encountering certain errors, or when configured to do so in a system filter,

warning message whenever it freezes something, unless the message it is
freezing is a locally-generated bounce message. (Without this exception there
is the possibility of looping.) The warning message is sent to the addresses
supplied as the comma-separated value of this option. If several of the
message’s addresses cause freezing, only a single message is sent. If the
freezing was automatic, the reason(s) for freezing can be found in the message
log. If you configure freezing in a filter or ACL, you must arrange for any

Some operating systems, notably HP-UX, use the “gecos” field in the system
password file to hold other information in addition to users’ real names. Exim

this option. Note that this is a syntax check only. See <span class="docbook_option">helo_verify_hosts</span>
if you want to do semantic checking.
See also <span class="docbook_option">helo_allow_chars</span> for a way of extending the permitted character
set.

This option can be set to a string of rogue characters that are permitted in
all EHLO and HELO names in addition to the standard letters, digits,
hyphens, and dots. If you really must allow underscores, you can set

If the domain given by a client in a HELO or EHLO command matches this
list, a reverse lookup is done in order to establish the host’s true name. The
default forces a lookup if the client host gives the server’s name or any of
its IP addresses (in brackets), something that broken clients have been seen to
do.

By default, Exim just checks the syntax of HELO and EHLO commands (see
<span class="docbook_option">helo_accept_junk_hosts</span> and <span class="docbook_option">helo_allow_chars</span>). However, some sites like
to do more extensive checking of the data supplied by these commands. The ACL
condition <code class="docbook_literal">verify = helo</code> is provided to make this possible.
Formerly, it was necessary also to set this option (<span class="docbook_option">helo_try_verify_hosts</span>)
to force the check to occur. From release 4.53 onwards, this is no longer
necessary. If the check has not been done before <code class="docbook_literal">verify = helo</code> is
encountered, it is done at that time. Consequently, this option is obsolete.
Its specification is retained here for backwards compatibility.
</p>
<p>
When an EHLO or HELO command is received, if the calling host matches
<span class="docbook_option">helo_try_verify_hosts</span>, Exim checks that the host name given in the HELO or
EHLO command either:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
is an IP literal matching the calling address of the host, or
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>


matches the host name that Exim obtains by doing a reverse lookup of the
calling host address, or
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
when looked up using <span class="docbook_function">gethostbyname()</span> (or <span class="docbook_function">getipnodebyname()</span> when
available) yields the calling host address.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
However, the EHLO or HELO command is not rejected if any of the checks
fail. Processing continues, but the result of the check is remembered, and can
be detected later in an ACL by the <code class="docbook_literal">verify = helo</code> condition.

Like <span class="docbook_option">helo_try_verify_hosts</span>, this option is obsolete, and retained only for

<span class="docbook_option">helo_try_verify_hosts</span>. If the check fails, the HELO or EHLO command is
rejected with a 550 error, and entries are written to the main and reject logs.
If a MAIL command is received before EHLO or HELO, it is rejected with a 503

This option allows mail for particular domains to be held on the queue
manually. The option is overridden if a message delivery is forced with the
<span class="docbook_option">-M</span>, <span class="docbook_option">-qf</span>, <span class="docbook_option">-Rf</span> or <span class="docbook_option">-Sf</span> options, and also while testing or
verifying addresses using <span class="docbook_option">-bt</span> or <span class="docbook_option">-bv</span>. Otherwise, if a domain matches an
item in <span class="docbook_option">hold_domains</span>, no routing or delivery for that address is done, and
it is deferred every time the message is looked at.
</p>
<p>
This option is intended as a temporary operational measure for delaying the
delivery of mail while some problem is being sorted out, or some new
configuration tested. If you just want to delay the processing of some
domains until a queue run occurs, you should use <span class="docbook_option">queue_domains</span> or
<span class="docbook_option">queue_smtp_domains</span>, not <span class="docbook_option">hold_domains</span>.
</p>
<p>
A setting of <span class="docbook_option">hold_domains</span> does not override Exim’s code for removing
messages from the queue if they have been there longer than the longest retry
time in any retry rule. If you want to hold messages for longer than the normal
retry times, insert a dummy retry rule with a long retry time.

Exim does not look up the name of a calling host from its IP address unless it
is required to compare against some host list, or the host matches
<span class="docbook_option">helo_try_verify_hosts</span> or <span class="docbook_option">helo_verify_hosts</span>, or the host matches this
option (which normally contains IP addresses rather than host names). The
default configuration file contains
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
host_lookup = *
</pre></div>
<p>
which causes a lookup to happen for all hosts. If the expense of these lookups
is felt to be too great, the setting can be changed or removed.
</p>
<p>
After a successful reverse lookup, Exim does a forward lookup on the name it
has obtained, to verify that it yields the IP address that it started with. If
this check fails, Exim behaves as if the name lookup failed.
</p>
<p>


After any kind of failure, the host name (in $sender_host_name) remains
unset, and $host_lookup_failed is set to the string “1”. See also
<span class="docbook_option">dns_again_means_nonexist</span>, <span class="docbook_option">helo_lookup_domains</span>, and

This option specifies the order of different lookup methods when Exim is trying

if that fails. You can change the order of these lookups, or omit one entirely,
if you want.

<span class="docbook_emphasis">Warning</span>: The “byaddr” method does not always yield aliases when there are

If this option is set, incoming SMTP calls from the hosts listed are rejected

This option is obsolete, and retained only for backward compatibility, because
nowadays the ACL specified by <span class="docbook_option">acl_smtp_connect</span> can also reject incoming
connections immediately.
</p>
<p>
The ability to give an immediate rejection (either by this option or using an
ACL) is provided for use in unusual cases. Many hosts will just try again,
sometimes without much delay. Normally, it is better to use an ACL to reject
incoming messages at a later stage, such as after RCPT commands. See

This option defines a list of hosts for which connection logging does not
happen, even though the <span class="docbook_option">smtp_connection</span> log selector is set. For example,
you might want not to log SMTP connections from local processes, or from
127.0.0.1, or from your local LAN. This option is consulted in the main loop of
the daemon; you should therefore strive to restrict its value to a short inline
list of IP addresses and networks. To disable logging SMTP connections from
local processes, you must create a host list with an empty item. For example:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
hosts_connection_nolog = :

<p>
If the <span class="docbook_option">smtp_connection</span> log selector is not set, this option has no effect.

This option affects the processing of bounce messages that cannot be delivered,
that is, those that suffer a permanent delivery failure. (Bounce messages that
suffer temporary delivery failures are of course retried in the usual way.)
</p>
<p>
After a permanent delivery failure, bounce messages are frozen,
because there is no sender to whom they can be returned. When a frozen bounce
message has been on the queue for more than the given time, it is unfrozen at
the next queue run, and a further delivery is attempted. If delivery fails
again, the bounce message is discarded. This makes it possible to keep failed
bounce messages around for a shorter time than the normal maximum retry time
for frozen messages. For example,
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
ignore_bounce_errors_after = 12h
</pre></div>
<p>
retries failed bounce message deliveries after 12 hours, discarding any further
failures. If the value of this option is set to a zero time period, bounce
failures are discarded immediately. Setting a very long time (as in the default
value) has the effect of disabling this option. For ways of automatically
dealing with other kinds of frozen message, see <span class="docbook_option">auto_thaw</span> and
<span class="docbook_option">timeout_frozen_after</span>.

Some broken SMTP clients insist on sending a UUCP-like “From ” line before

match those hosts that insist on sending it. If the sender is actually a local
process rather than a remote host, and is using <span class="docbook_option">-bs</span> to inject the messages,

When a message is submitted locally (that is, not over a TCP/IP connection) by
an untrusted user, Exim removes any existing <span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header line, and

the domain specified by <span class="docbook_option">qualify_domain</span>.
</p>
<p>
<span class="docbook_emphasis">Note</span>: An unqualified address (no domain) in the <span class="docbook_emphasis">From:</span> header in a

</p>
<p>
You can use <span class="docbook_option">local_from_prefix</span> and <span class="docbook_option">local_from_suffix</span> to permit affixes

<span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header with an address constructed from the calling user’s login
and the default qualify domain.
</p>
<p>
If <span class="docbook_option">local_from_check</span> is set false, the <span class="docbook_emphasis">From:</span> header check is disabled,
and no <span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header is ever added. If, in addition, you want to retain
<span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header lines supplied by untrusted users, you must also set
<span class="docbook_option">local_sender_retain</span> to be true.

These options affect only the header lines in the message. The envelope sender
is still forced to be the login id at the qualify domain unless

This timeout applies to the <span class="docbook_function">local_scan()</span> function (see chapter
<a href="ch44.html" title="44. Adding a local scan function to Exim">44</a>). Zero means “no timeout”. If the timeout is exceeded,
the incoming message is rejected with a temporary error if it is an SMTP
message. For a non-SMTP message, the message is dropped and Exim ends with a
non-zero code. The incident is logged on the main and reject logs.

When a message is submitted locally (that is, not over a TCP/IP connection) by
an untrusted user, Exim removes any existing <span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header line. If you
do not want this to happen, you must set <span class="docbook_option">local_sender_retain</span>, and you must
also set <span class="docbook_option">local_from_check</span> to be false (Exim will complain if you do not).
See also the ACL modifier <code class="docbook_literal">control = suppress_local_fixups</code>. Section

Exim’s message ids are normally unique only within the local host. If
uniqueness among a set of hosts is required, each host must set a different
value for the <span class="docbook_option">localhost_number</span> option. The string is expanded immediately
after reading the configuration file (so that a number can be computed from the
host name, for example) and the result of the expansion must be a number in the
range 0–16 (or 0–10 on operating systems with case-insensitive file
systems). This is available in subsequent string expansions via the variable
$localhost_number. When <span class="docbook_option">localhost_number is set</span>, the final two
characters of the message id, instead of just being a fractional part of the
time, are computed from the time and the local host number as described in
section <a href="ch03.html#SECTmessiden" title="3. How Exim receives and delivers mail">3.4</a>.

This option sets the path which is used to determine the names of Exim’s log
files, or indicates that logging is to be to syslog, or both. It is expanded
when Exim is entered, so it can, for example, contain a reference to the host
name. If no specific path is set for the log files at compile or run time, they
are written in a sub-directory called <span class="docbook_filename">log</span> in Exim’s spool directory.
Chapter <a href="ch51.html" title="51. Log files">51</a> contains further details about Exim’s logging, and
section <a href="ch51.html#SECTwhelogwri" title="51. Log files">51.1</a> describes how the contents of <span class="docbook_option">log_file_path</span> are
used. If this string is fixed at your installation (contains no expansion
variables) it is recommended that you do not set this option in the
configuration file, but instead supply the path using LOG_FILE_PATH in
<span class="docbook_filename">Local/Makefile</span> so that it is available to Exim for logging errors detected
early on – in particular, failure to read the configuration file.

This option can be used to reduce or increase the number of things that Exim
writes to its log files. Its argument is made up of names preceded by plus or
minus characters. For example:

By default, the timestamps on log lines are in local time without the
timezone. This means that if your timezone changes twice a year, the timestamps
in log lines are ambiguous for an hour when the clocks go back. One way of
avoiding this problem is to set the timezone to UTC. An alternative is to set
<span class="docbook_option">log_timezone</span> true. This turns on the addition of the timezone offset to
timestamps in log lines. Turning on this option can add quite a lot to the size
of log files because each line is extended by 6 characters. Note that the
$tod_log variable contains the log timestamp without the zone, but there is
another variable called $tod_zone that contains just the timezone offset.

This option limits the number of simultaneously open files for single-key
lookups that use regular files (that is, <span class="docbook_command">lsearch</span>, <span class="docbook_command">dbm</span>, and <span class="docbook_command">cdb</span>).
Exim normally keeps these files open during routing, because often the same
file is required several times. If the limit is reached, Exim closes the least
recently used file. Note that if you are using the <span class="docbook_emphasis">ndbm</span> library, it
actually opens two files for each logical DBM database, though it still counts
as one for the purposes of <span class="docbook_option">lookup_open_max</span>. If you are getting “too many

Some operating systems are broken in that they truncate long arguments to

means “not received over TCP/IP.”
Otherwise, the primary host name is used.
Only letters, digits, dot and hyphen are accepted; any other characters are
replaced by hyphens. If the expansion is forced to fail, or if the result is an

<p>
If this variable is set, the string is expanded and used to augment the text of

take the form of an address. By default, Exim uses its internal message id as
the local part, and the primary host name as the domain. If this option is set,
it is expanded, and provided the expansion is not forced to fail, and does not
yield an empty string, the result is inserted into the header immediately
before the @, separated from the internal message id by a dot. Any characters
that are illegal in an address are automatically converted into hyphens. This
means that variables such as $tod_log can be used, because the spaces and
colons will become hyphens.

If this option is turned off, per-message log files are not created in the

minimum of four (header spool file, body spool file, delivery journal, and
per-message log) to three. The other major I/O activity is Exim’s main log,

This option limits the maximum size of message that Exim will process. The
value is expanded for each incoming connection so, for example, it can be made
to depend on the IP address of the remote host for messages arriving via
TCP/IP. After expansion, the value must be a sequence of decimal digits,
optionally followed by K or M.
</p>
<p>
<span class="docbook_emphasis">Note</span>: This limit cannot be made to depend on a message’s sender or any
other properties of an individual message, because it has to be advertised in
the server’s response to EHLO. String expansion failure causes a temporary
error. A value of zero means no limit, but its use is not recommended. See also
<span class="docbook_option">bounce_return_size_limit</span>.
</p>
<p>
Incoming SMTP messages are failed with a 552 error if the limit is
exceeded; locally-generated messages either get a stderr message or a delivery
failure message to the sender, depending on the <span class="docbook_option">-oe</span> setting. Rejection of
an oversized message is logged in both the main and the reject logs. See also
the generic transport option <span class="docbook_option">message_size_limit</span>, which limits the size of
message that an individual transport can process.
</p>
<p>
If you use a virus-scanner and set this option to to a value larger than the
maximum size that your virus-scanner is configured to support, you may get
failures triggered by large mails.  The right size to configure for the
virus-scanner depends upon what data is passed and the options in use but it’s
probably safest to just set it to a little larger than this value.  Eg, with a
default Exim message size of 50M and a default ClamAV StreamMaxLength of 10M,
some problems may result.
</p>
<p>
A value of 0 will disable size limit checking; Exim will still advertise the
SIZE extension in an EHLO response, but without a limit, so as to permit
SMTP clients to still indicate the message size along with the MAIL verb.

This option is expanded just once, at the start of Exim’s processing. Local
message deliveries are normally run in processes that are setuid to the
recipient, and remote deliveries are normally run under Exim’s own uid and gid.
It is usually desirable to prevent any deliveries from running as root, as a
safety precaution.
</p>
<p>
When Exim is built, an option called FIXED_NEVER_USERS can be set to a
list of users that must not be used for local deliveries. This list is fixed in
the binary and cannot be overridden by the configuration file. By default, it
contains just the single user name “root”. The <span class="docbook_option">never_users</span> runtime option
can be used to add more users to the fixed list.
</p>
<p>
If a message is to be delivered as one of the users on the fixed list or the
<span class="docbook_option">never_users</span> list, an error occurs, and delivery is deferred. A common
example is
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
never_users = root:daemon:bin

Including root is redundant if it is also on the fixed list, but it does no

This option allows an administrator to adjust the SSL options applied
by OpenSSL to connections.  It is given as a space-separated list of items,
each one to be +added or -subtracted from the current value.
</p>
<p>
This option is only available if Exim is built against OpenSSL.  The values
available for this option vary according to the age of your OpenSSL install.
The “all” value controls a subset of flags which are available, typically
the bug workaround options.  The <span class="docbook_emphasis">SSL_CTX_set_options</span> man page will
list the values known on your system and Exim should support all the
“bug workaround” options and many of the “modifying” options.  The Exim
names lose the leading “SSL_OP_” and are lower-cased.
</p>
<p>
Note that adjusting the options can have severe impact upon the security of
SSL as used by Exim.  It is possible to disable safety checks and shoot
yourself in the foot in various unpleasant ways.  This option should not be
adjusted lightly.  An unrecognised item will be detected at startup, by
invoking Exim with the <span class="docbook_option">-bV</span> flag.

The “percent hack” is the convention whereby a local part containing a
percent sign is re-interpreted as a new email address, with the percent
replaced by @. This is sometimes called “source routing”, though that term is
also applied to RFC 2822 addresses that begin with an @ character. If this
option is set, Exim implements the percent facility for those domains listed,
but no others. This happens before an incoming SMTP address is tested against
an ACL.
</p>
<p>
<span class="docbook_emphasis">Warning</span>: The “percent hack” has often been abused by people who are
trying to get round relaying restrictions. For this reason, it is best avoided
if at all possible. Unfortunately, a number of less security-conscious MTAs
implement it unconditionally. If you are running Exim on a gateway host, and
routing mail through to internal MTAs without processing the local parts, it is
a good idea to reject recipient addresses with percent characters in their
local parts. Exim’s default configuration does this.

This option sets the name of the file to which the Exim daemon writes its
process id. The string is expanded, so it can contain, for example, references
to the host name:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
pid_file_path = /var/log/$primary_hostname/exim.pid
</pre></div>
<p>
If no path is set, the pid is written to the file <span class="docbook_filename">exim-daemon.pid</span> in Exim’s
spool directory.
The value set by the option can be overridden by the <span class="docbook_option">-oP</span> command line

<p>
If <span class="docbook_option">primary_hostname</span> is not set, Exim calls <span class="docbook_function">uname()</span> to find the host
name. If this fails, Exim panics and dies. If the name returned by <span class="docbook_function">uname()</span>
contains only one component, Exim passes it to <span class="docbook_function">gethostbyname()</span> (or
<span class="docbook_function">getipnodebyname()</span> when available) in order to obtain the fully qualified
version. The variable $primary_hostname contains the host name, whether set

By default, Exim considers only those characters whose codes lie in the range
32–126 to be printing characters. In a number of circumstances (for example,
when writing log entries) non-printing characters are converted into escape
sequences, primarily to avoid messing up the layout. If <span class="docbook_option">print_topbitchars</span>
is set, code values of 128 and above are also considered to be printing
characters.
</p>
<p>
This option also affects the header syntax checks performed by the

the user’s full name when constructing From: and Sender: addresses (as
described in section <a href="ch46.html#SECTconstr" title="46. Message processing">46.18</a>). Setting this option can cause
Exim to generate eight bit message headers that do not conform to the

addresses that do not have a domain qualification. It also applies to
recipient addresses if <span class="docbook_option">qualify_recipient</span> is not set. Unqualified addresses

This option can be set to a colon-separated list of absolute path names, each
one optionally preceded by “smtp”. When Exim is receiving a message,
it tests for the existence of each listed path using a call to <span class="docbook_function">stat()</span>. For
each path that exists, the corresponding queueing option is set.
For paths with no prefix, <span class="docbook_option">queue_only</span> is set; for paths prefixed by
“smtp”, <span class="docbook_option">queue_smtp_domains</span> is set to match all domains. So, for example,
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
queue_only_file = smtp/some/file

If the system load average is higher than this value, incoming messages from
all sources are queued, and no automatic deliveries are started. If this
happens during local or remote SMTP input, all subsequent messages received on
the same SMTP connection are queued by default, whatever happens to the load in
the meantime, but this can be changed by setting <span class="docbook_option">queue_only_load_latch</span>
false.
</p>
<p>
Deliveries will subsequently be performed by queue runner processes. This
option has no effect on ancient operating systems on which Exim cannot
determine the load average. See also <span class="docbook_option">deliver_queue_load_max</span> and

When this option is true (the default), once one message has been queued
because the load average is higher than the value set by <span class="docbook_option">queue_only_load</span>,
all subsequent messages received on the same SMTP connection are also queued.
This is a deliberate choice; even though the load average may fall below the
threshold, it doesn’t seem right to deliver later messages on the same
connection when not delivering earlier ones. However, there are special
circumstances such as very long-lived connections from scanning appliances
where this is not the best strategy. In such cases, <span class="docbook_option">queue_only_load_latch</span>
should be set false. This causes the value of the load average to be
re-evaluated for each message.

If this option is set, queue runs happen in order of message arrival instead of
in an arbitrary order. For this to happen, a complete list of the entire queue
must be set up before the deliveries start. When the queue is all held in a
single directory (the default), a single list is created for both the ordered
and the non-ordered cases. However, if <span class="docbook_option">split_spool_directory</span> is set, a
single list is not created when <span class="docbook_option">queue_run_in_order</span> is false. In this case,
the sub-directories are processed one at a time (in a random order), and this
avoids setting up one huge list for the whole queue. Thus, setting
<span class="docbook_option">queue_run_in_order</span> with <span class="docbook_option">split_spool_directory</span> may degrade performance
when the queue is large, because of the extra work in setting up the single,
large list. In most situations, <span class="docbook_option">queue_run_in_order</span> should not be set.

This controls the maximum number of queue runner processes that an Exim daemon
can run simultaneously. This does not mean that it starts them all at once,
but rather that if the maximum number are still running when the time comes to
start another one, it refrains from starting another one. This can happen with
very large queues and/or very sluggish deliveries. This option does not,
however, interlock with other processes, so additional queue runners can be
started by other means, or by killing and restarting the daemon.
</p>
<p>
Setting this option to zero does not suppress queue runs; rather, it disables
the limit, allowing any number of simultaneous queue runner processes to be
run. If you do not want queue runs to occur, omit the <span class="docbook_option">-q</span><span class="docbook_emphasis">xx</span> setting on

When this option is set, a delivery process is started whenever a message is

However, if any SMTP deliveries are required for domains that match
<span class="docbook_option">queue_smtp_domains</span>, they are not immediately delivered, but instead the
message waits on the queue for the next queue run. Since routing of the message
has taken place, Exim knows to which remote hosts it must be delivered, and so
when the queue run happens, multiple messages for the same host are delivered
over a single SMTP connection. The <span class="docbook_option">-odqs</span> command line option causes all
SMTP deliveries to be queued in this way, and is equivalent to setting
<span class="docbook_option">queue_smtp_domains</span> to “*”. See also <span class="docbook_option">hold_domains</span> and

This string defines the contents of the <span class="docbook_emphasis">Received:</span> message header that is
added to each message, except for the timestamp, which is automatically added
on at the end (preceded by a semicolon). The string is expanded each time it is
used. If the expansion yields an empty string, no <span class="docbook_emphasis">Received:</span> header line is
added to the message. Otherwise, the string should start with the text
“Received:” and conform to the RFC 2822 specification for <span class="docbook_emphasis">Received:</span>
header lines. The default setting is:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
received_header_text = Received: \
  ${if def:sender_rcvhost {from $sender_rcvhost\n\t}\
  {${if def:sender_ident \

</pre></div>
<p>
The reference to the TLS cipher is omitted when Exim is built without TLS
support. The use of conditional expansions ensures that this works for both
locally generated messages and messages received from remote hosts, giving
header lines such as the following:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
Received: from scrooge.carol.example ([192.168.12.25] ident=root)

</pre></div>
<p>
Until the body of the message has been received, the timestamp is the time when
the message started to be received. Once the body has arrived, and all policy
checks have taken place, the timestamp is updated to the time at which the
message was accepted.

If this option is set true, Exim rejects SMTP messages containing too many
recipients by giving 552 errors to the surplus RCPT commands, and a 554
error to the eventual DATA command. Otherwise (the default) it gives a 452
error to the surplus RCPT commands and accepts the message on behalf of the
initial set of recipients. The remote server should then re-send the message
for the remaining recipients at a later time.

This option controls parallel delivery of one message to a number of remote
hosts. If the value is less than 2, parallel delivery is disabled, and Exim
does all the remote deliveries for a message one by one. Otherwise, if a single
message has to be delivered to more than one remote host, or if several copies
have to be sent to the same remote host, up to <span class="docbook_option">remote_max_parallel</span>
deliveries are done simultaneously. If more than <span class="docbook_option">remote_max_parallel</span>
deliveries are required, the maximum number of processes are started, and as
each one finishes, another is begun. The order of starting processes is the
same as if sequential delivery were being done, and can be controlled by the
<span class="docbook_option">remote_sort_domains</span> option. If parallel delivery takes place while running
with debugging turned on, the debugging output from each delivery process is
tagged with its process id.
</p>
<p>
This option controls only the maximum number of parallel deliveries for one
message in one Exim delivery process. Because Exim has no central queue
manager, there is no way of controlling the total number of simultaneous
deliveries if the configuration allows a delivery attempt as soon as a message
is received.
</p>
<p>


If you want to control the total number of deliveries on the system, you
need to set the <span class="docbook_option">queue_only</span> option. This ensures that all incoming messages
are added to the queue without starting a delivery process. Then set up an Exim
daemon to start queue runner processes at appropriate intervals (probably
fairly often, for example, every minute), and limit the total number of queue
runners by setting the <span class="docbook_option">queue_run_max</span> parameter. Because each queue runner
delivers only one message at a time, the maximum number of deliveries that can
then take place at once is <span class="docbook_option">queue_run_max</span> multiplied by
<span class="docbook_option">remote_max_parallel</span>.
</p>
<p>
If it is purely remote deliveries you want to control, use
<span class="docbook_option">queue_smtp_domains</span> instead of <span class="docbook_option">queue_only</span>. This has the added benefit of
doing the SMTP routing before queueing, so that several messages for the same
host will eventually get delivered down the same connection.

This option controls the setting of the SO_KEEPALIVE option on incoming
TCP/IP socket connections. When set, it causes the kernel to probe idle
connections periodically, by sending packets with “old” sequence numbers. The
other end of the connection should send an acknowledgment if the connection is
still okay or a reset if the connection has been aborted. The reason for doing
this is that it has the beneficial effect of freeing up certain types of
connection that can get stuck when the remote host is disconnected without
tidying up the TCP/IP call properly. The keepalive mechanism takes several
hours to detect unreachable hosts.

This option specifies the maximum number of simultaneous incoming SMTP calls
that Exim will accept. It applies only to the listening daemon; there is no
control (in Exim) when incoming SMTP is being handled by <span class="docbook_emphasis">inetd</span>. If the
value is set to zero, no limit is applied. However, it is required to be
non-zero if either <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max_per_host</span> or <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_queue</span> is

<p>
A new SMTP connection is immediately rejected if the <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max</span> limit
has been reached. If not, Exim first checks <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max_per_host</span>. If
that limit has not been reached for the client host, <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_reserve</span>

Exim counts the number of “non-mail” commands in an SMTP session, and drops
the connection if there are too many. This option defines “too many”. The
check catches some denial-of-service attacks, repeated failing AUTHs, or a mad
client looping sending EHLO, for example. The check is applied only if the
client host matches <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max_nonmail_hosts</span>.
</p>
<p>
When a new message is expected, one occurrence of RSET is not counted. This
allows a client to send one RSET between messages (this is not necessary,
but some clients do it). Exim also allows one uncounted occurrence of HELO
or EHLO, and one occurrence of STARTTLS between messages. After
starting up a TLS session, another EHLO is expected, and so it too is not
counted. The first occurrence of AUTH in a connection, or immediately
following STARTTLS is not counted. Otherwise, all commands other than
MAIL, RCPT, DATA, and QUIT are counted.

This option restricts the number of simultaneous IP connections from a single
host (strictly, from a single IP address) to the Exim daemon. The option is
expanded, to enable different limits to be applied to different hosts by
reference to $sender_host_address. Once the limit is reached, additional
connection attempts from the same host are rejected with error code 421. This
is entirely independent of <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_reserve</span>. The option’s default value
of zero imposes no limit. If this option is set greater than zero, it is
required that <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max</span> be non-zero.
</p>
<p>
<span class="docbook_emphasis">Warning</span>: When setting this option you should not use any expansion
constructions that take an appreciable amount of time. The expansion and test
happen in the main daemon loop, in order to reject additional connections
without forking additional processes (otherwise a denial-of-service attack
could cause a vast number or processes to be created). While the daemon is
doing this processing, it cannot accept any other incoming connections.

If the number of simultaneous incoming SMTP connections being handled via the
listening daemon exceeds this value, messages received by SMTP are just placed
on the queue; no delivery processes are started automatically. The count is
fixed at the start of an SMTP connection. It cannot be updated in the
subprocess that receives messages, and so the queueing or not queueing applies
to all messages received in the same connection.

A value of zero implies no limit, and clearly any non-zero value is useful only
if it is less than the <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max</span> value (unless that is zero). See

This option limits the number of delivery processes that Exim starts
automatically when receiving messages via SMTP, whether via the daemon or by
the use of <span class="docbook_option">-bs</span> or <span class="docbook_option">-bS</span>. If the value of the option is greater than zero,
and the number of messages received in a single SMTP session exceeds this
number, subsequent messages are placed on the queue, but no delivery processes
are started. This helps to limit the number of Exim processes when a server
restarts after downtime and there is a lot of mail waiting for it on other
systems. On large systems, the default should probably be increased, and on
dial-in client systems it should probably be set to zero (that is, disabled).

When <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max</span> is set greater than zero, this option specifies a
number of SMTP connections that are reserved for connections from the hosts
that are specified in <span class="docbook_option">smtp_reserve_hosts</span>. The value set in
<span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max</span> includes this reserve pool. The specified hosts are not
restricted to this number of connections; the option specifies a minimum number
of connection slots for them, not a maximum. It is a guarantee that this group
of hosts can always get at least <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_reserve</span> connections. However,
the limit specified by <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max_per_host</span> is still applied to each
individual host.
</p>
<p>
For example, if <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_max</span> is set to 50 and <span class="docbook_option">smtp_accept_reserve</span> is
set to 5, once there are 45 active connections (from any hosts), new

This option is provided for multi-homed servers that want to masquerade as
several different hosts. At the start of an incoming SMTP connection, its value
is expanded and used instead of the value of $primary_hostname in SMTP
responses. For example, it is used as domain name in the response to an
incoming HELO or EHLO command.
</p>
<p>

The active hostname is placed in the $smtp_active_hostname variable, which
is saved with any messages that are received. It is therefore available for use
in routers and transports when the message is later delivered.
</p>
<p>
If this option is unset, or if its expansion is forced to fail, or if the
expansion results in an empty string, the value of $primary_hostname is
used. Other expansion failures cause a message to be written to the main and
panic logs, and the SMTP command receives a temporary error. Typically, the
value of <span class="docbook_option">smtp_active_hostname</span> depends on the incoming interface address.
For example:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
smtp_active_hostname = ${if eq{$received_ip_address}{10.0.0.1}\
  {cox.mydomain}{box.mydomain}}
</pre></div>
<p>
Although $smtp_active_hostname is primarily concerned with incoming
messages, it is also used as the default for HELO commands in callout
verification if there is no remote transport from which to obtain a
<span class="docbook_option">helo_data</span> value.

Failure to expand the string causes a panic error. If you want to create a
multiline response to the initial SMTP connection, use “\n” in the string at

This option specifies a maximum number of waiting SMTP connections. Exim passes
this value to the TCP/IP system when it sets up its listener. Once this number
of connections are waiting for the daemon’s attention, subsequent connection
attempts are refused at the TCP/IP level. At least, that is what the manuals
say; in some circumstances such connection attempts have been observed to time
out instead. For large systems it is probably a good idea to increase the
value (to 50, say). It also gives some protection against denial-of-service
attacks by SYN flooding.

The SMTP protocol specification requires the client to wait for a response from
the server at certain points in the dialogue. Without PIPELINING these
synchronization points are after every command; with PIPELINING they are
fewer, but they still exist.
</p>
<p>
Some spamming sites send out a complete set of SMTP commands without waiting
for any response. Exim protects against this by rejecting a message if the
client has sent further input when it should not have. The error response “554
SMTP synchronization error” is sent, and the connection is dropped. Testing
for this error cannot be perfect because of transmission delays (unexpected
input may be on its way but not yet received when Exim checks). However, it
does detect many instances.
</p>
<p>
The check can be globally disabled by setting <span class="docbook_option">smtp_enforce_sync</span> false.
If you want to disable the check selectively (for example, only for certain
hosts), you can do so by an appropriate use of a <span class="docbook_option">control</span> modifier in an ACL
(see section <a href="ch42.html#SECTcontrols" title="42. Access control lists">42.21</a>). See also <span class="docbook_option">pipelining_advertise_hosts</span>.

If this option is set, the given command is run whenever an SMTP ETRN
command is received from a host that is permitted to issue such commands (see
chapter <a href="ch42.html" title="42. Access control lists">42</a>). The string is split up into separate arguments which
are independently expanded. The expansion variable $domain is set to the
argument of the ETRN command, and no syntax checking is done on it. For
example:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
smtp_etrn_command = /etc/etrn_command $domain \
                    $sender_host_address
</pre></div>
<p>
A new process is created to run the command, but Exim does not wait for it to
complete. Consequently, its status cannot be checked. If the command cannot be
run, a line is written to the panic log, but the ETRN caller still receives
a 250 success response. Exim is normally running under its own uid when
receiving SMTP, so it is not possible for it to change the uid before running
the command.

Exim rejects SMTP commands that contain syntax or protocol errors. In
particular, a syntactically invalid email address, as in this command:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
RCPT TO:&lt;abc xyz@a.b.c&gt;
</pre></div>
<p>
causes immediate rejection of the command, before any other tests are done.
(The ACL cannot be run if there is no valid address to set up for it.) An
example of a protocol error is receiving RCPT before MAIL. If there are
too many syntax or protocol errors in one SMTP session, the connection is
dropped. The limit is set by this option.
</p>
<p>

When the PIPELINING extension to SMTP is in use, some protocol errors are
“expected”, for instance, a RCPT command after a rejected MAIL command.
Exim assumes that PIPELINING will be used if it advertises it (see
<span class="docbook_option">pipelining_advertise_hosts</span>), and in this situation, “expected” errors do
not count towards the limit.

If there are too many unrecognized commands in an incoming SMTP session, an
Exim server drops the connection. This is a defence against some kinds of abuse
that subvert web
clients
into making connections to SMTP ports; in these circumstances, a number of
non-SMTP command lines are sent first.

Some sites find it helpful to be able to limit the rate at which certain hosts
can send them messages, and the rate at which an individual message can specify
recipients.
</p>
<p>
Exim has two rate-limiting facilities. This section describes the older
facility, which can limit rates within a single connection. The newer
<span class="docbook_option">ratelimit</span> ACL condition can limit rates across all connections. See section
<a href="ch42.html#SECTratelimiting" title="42. Access control lists">42.36</a> for details of the newer facility.
</p>
<p>
When a host matches <span class="docbook_option">smtp_ratelimit_hosts</span>, the values of
<span class="docbook_option">smtp_ratelimit_mail</span> and <span class="docbook_option">smtp_ratelimit_rcpt</span> are used to control the
rate of acceptance of MAIL and RCPT commands in a single SMTP session,
respectively. Each option, if set, must contain a set of four comma-separated
values:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
A threshold, before which there is no rate limiting.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An initial time delay. Unlike other times in Exim, numbers with decimal
fractional parts are allowed here.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A factor by which to increase the delay each time.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A maximum value for the delay. This should normally be less than 5 minutes,
because after that time, the client is liable to timeout the SMTP command.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
For example, these settings have been used successfully at the site which
first suggested this feature, for controlling mail from their customers:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
smtp_ratelimit_mail = 2,0.5s,1.05,4m
smtp_ratelimit_rcpt = 4,0.25s,1.015,4m
</pre></div>
<p>
The first setting specifies delays that are applied to MAIL commands after
two have been received over a single connection. The initial delay is 0.5
seconds, increasing by a factor of 1.05 each time. The second setting applies
delays to RCPT commands when more than four occur in a single message.

This sets a timeout value for SMTP reception. It applies to all forms of SMTP
input, including batch SMTP. If a line of input (either an SMTP command or a
data line) is not received within this time, the SMTP connection is dropped and
the message is abandoned.
A line is written to the log containing one of the following messages:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
SMTP command timeout on connection from...
SMTP data timeout on connection from...
</pre></div>
<p>
The former means that Exim was expecting to read an SMTP command; the latter
means that it was in the DATA phase, reading the contents of a message.
</p>
<p>

The value set by this option can be overridden by the
<span class="docbook_option">-os</span> command-line option. A setting of zero time disables the timeout, but
this should never be used for SMTP over TCP/IP. (It can be useful in some cases
of local input using <span class="docbook_option">-bs</span> or <span class="docbook_option">-bS</span>.) For non-SMTP input, the reception
timeout is controlled by <span class="docbook_option">receive_timeout</span> and <span class="docbook_option">-or</span>.

In the default state, Exim uses bland messages such as
“Administrative prohibition” when it rejects SMTP commands for policy
reasons. Many sysadmins like this because it gives away little information
to spammers. However, some other sysadmins who are applying strict checking
policies want to give out much fuller information about failures. Setting
<span class="docbook_option">smtp_return_error_details</span> true causes Exim to be more forthcoming. For
example, instead of “Administrative prohibition”, it might give:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
550-Rejected after DATA: '&gt;' missing at end of address:
550 failing address in "From" header is: &lt;user@dom.ain

<p>



If this option is set, it causes Exim to split its input directory into 62
subdirectories, each with a single alphanumeric character as its name. The
sixth character of the message id is used to allocate messages to
subdirectories; this is the least significant base-62 digit of the time of
arrival of the message.
</p>
<p>
Splitting up the spool in this way may provide better performance on systems
where there are long mail queues, by reducing the number of files in any one
directory. The msglog directory is also split up in a similar way to the input
directory; however, if <span class="docbook_option">preserve_message_logs</span> is set, all old msglog files
are still placed in the single directory <span class="docbook_filename">msglog.OLD</span>.
</p>
<p>
It is not necessary to take any special action for existing messages when
changing <span class="docbook_option">split_spool_directory</span>. Exim notices messages that are in the
“wrong” place, and continues to process them. If the option is turned off
after a period of being on, the subdirectories will eventually empty and be
automatically deleted.
</p>
<p>
When <span class="docbook_option">split_spool_directory</span> is set, the behaviour of queue runner processes
changes. Instead of creating a list of all messages in the queue, and then
trying to deliver each one in turn, it constructs a list of those in one
sub-directory and tries to deliver them, before moving on to the next
sub-directory. The sub-directories are processed in a random order. This
spreads out the scanning of the input directories, and uses less memory. It is
particularly beneficial when there are lots of messages on the queue. However,
if <span class="docbook_option">queue_run_in_order</span> is set, none of this new processing happens. The
entire queue has to be scanned and sorted before any deliveries can start.

This defines the directory in which Exim keeps its spool, that is, the messages
it is waiting to deliver. The default value is taken from the compile-time
configuration setting, if there is one. If not, this option must be set. The
string is expanded, so it can contain, for example, a reference to
$primary_hostname.
</p>
<p>
If the spool directory name is fixed on your installation, it is recommended
that you set it at build time rather than from this option, particularly if the
log files are being written to the spool directory (see <span class="docbook_option">log_file_path</span>).
Otherwise log files cannot be used for errors that are detected early on, such
as failures in the configuration file.
</p>
<p>
By using this option to override the compiled-in path, it is possible to run
tests of Exim without using the standard spool.

When Exim is logging to syslog, it writes the log lines for its three
separate logs at different syslog priorities so that they can in principle
be separated on the logging hosts. Some installations do not require this
separation, and in those cases, the duplication of certain log lines is a
nuisance. If <span class="docbook_option">syslog_duplication</span> is set false, only one copy of any
particular log line is written to syslog. For lines that normally go to
both the main log and the reject log, the reject log version (possibly
containing message header lines) is written, at LOG_NOTICE priority.
Lines that normally go to both the main and the panic log are written at
the LOG_ALERT priority.

should improve Exim’s performance a bit, so that is what happens by default.
However, it appears that some broken clients cannot cope, and time out. Hence
this option. It affects only those sockets that are set up for listening by the
daemon. Sockets created by the smtp transport for delivering mail always set
TCP_NODELAY.

These certificates should be for the certificate authorities trusted, rather
than the public cert of individual clients.  With both OpenSSL and GnuTLS, if
the value is a file then the certificates are sent by Exim as a server to

Thus the values defined should be considered public data.  To avoid this,
use OpenSSL with a directory.

This option, along with <span class="docbook_option">tls_try_verify_hosts</span>, controls the checking of

<span class="docbook_option">tls_verify_certificates</span>, which must be set. A configuration error occurs if

<p>
Any client that matches <span class="docbook_option">tls_verify_hosts</span> is constrained by
<span class="docbook_option">tls_verify_certificates</span>. When the client initiates a TLS session, it must
present one of the listed certificates. If it does not, the connection is
aborted. <span class="docbook_emphasis">Warning</span>: Including a host in <span class="docbook_option">tls_verify_hosts</span> does not require
the host to use TLS. It can still send SMTP commands through unencrypted
connections. Forcing a client to use TLS has to be done separately using an
ACL to reject inappropriate commands when the connection is not encrypted.
</p>
<p>
A weaker form of checking is provided by <span class="docbook_option">tls_try_verify_hosts</span>. If a client
matches this option (but not <span class="docbook_option">tls_verify_hosts</span>), Exim requests a
certificate and checks it against <span class="docbook_option">tls_verify_certificates</span>, but does not
abort the connection if there is no certificate or if it does not match. This
state can be detected in an ACL, which makes it possible to implement policies
such as “accept for relay only if a verified certificate has been received,
but accept for local delivery if encrypted, even without a verified
certificate”.

When an untrusted user submits a message to Exim using the standard input, Exim
normally creates an envelope sender address from the user’s login and the
default qualification domain. Data from the <span class="docbook_option">-f</span> option (for setting envelope
senders on non-SMTP messages) or the SMTP MAIL command (if <span class="docbook_option">-bs</span> or <span class="docbook_option">-bS</span>
is used) is ignored.
</p>
<p>
However, untrusted users are permitted to set an empty envelope sender address,
to declare that a message should never generate any bounces. For example:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
exim -f '&lt;&gt;' user@domain.example
</pre></div>
<p>

The <span class="docbook_option">untrusted_set_sender</span> option allows you to permit untrusted users to set
other envelope sender addresses in a controlled way. When it is set, untrusted
users are allowed to set envelope sender addresses that match any of the
patterns in the list. Like all address lists, the string is expanded. The
identity of the user is in $sender_ident, so you can, for example, restrict
users to setting senders that start with their login ids
followed by a hyphen
by a setting like this:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
untrusted_set_sender = ^$sender_ident-
</pre></div>
<p>
If you want to allow untrusted users to set envelope sender addresses without
restriction, you can use
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
untrusted_set_sender = *
</pre></div>
<p>
The <span class="docbook_option">untrusted_set_sender</span> option applies to all forms of local input, but
only to the setting of the envelope sender. It does not permit untrusted users
to use the other options which trusted user can use to override message
parameters. Furthermore, it does not stop Exim from removing an existing
<span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header in the message, or from adding a <span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header if
necessary. See <span class="docbook_option">local_sender_retain</span> and <span class="docbook_option">local_from_check</span> for ways of
overriding these actions. The handling of the <span class="docbook_emphasis">Sender:</span> header is also
described in section <a href="ch46.html#SECTthesenhea" title="46. Message processing">46.16</a>.
</p>
<p>
The log line for a message’s arrival shows the envelope sender following
“&lt;=”. For local messages, the user’s login always follows, after “U=”. In
<span class="docbook_option">-bp</span> displays, and in the Exim monitor, if an untrusted user sets an
envelope sender address, the user’s login is shown in parentheses after the
sender address.

Some applications that pass messages to an MTA via a command line interface use
an initial line starting with “From ” to pass the envelope sender. In
particular, this is used by UUCP software. Exim recognizes such a line by means
of a regular expression that is set in <span class="docbook_option">uucp_from_pattern</span>. When the pattern
matches, the sender address is constructed by expanding the contents of
<span class="docbook_option">uucp_from_sender</span>, provided that the caller of Exim is a trusted user. The
default pattern recognizes lines in the following two forms:
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
From ph10 Fri Jan  5 12:35 GMT 1996
From ph10 Fri, 7 Jan 97 14:00:00 GMT
</pre></div>
<p>
The pattern can be seen by running
</p>
<div class="docbook_literallayout"><pre>
exim -bP uucp_from_pattern
</pre></div>
<p>
It checks only up to the hours and minutes, and allows for a 2-digit or 4-digit
year in the second case. The first word after “From ” is matched in the
regular expression by a parenthesized subpattern. The default value for
<span class="docbook_option">uucp_from_sender</span> is “$1”, which therefore just uses this first word
(“ph10” in the example above) as the message’s sender. See also
