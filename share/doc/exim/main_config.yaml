For example:\n</p>\n<div class=\"docbook_literallayout\"><pre>\nexim -f '<>' user@domain.example\n</pre></div>\n<p>\n\nThe <span class=\"docbook_option\">untrusted_set_sender</span> option allows you to permit untrusted users to set\nother envelope sender addresses in a controlled way. When it is set, untrusted\nusers are allowed to set envelope sender addresses that match any of the\npatterns in the list. Like all address lists, the string is expanded. The\nidentity of the user is in $sender_ident, so you can, for example, restrict\nusers to setting senders that start with their login ids\nfollowed by a hyphen\nby a setting like this:\n</p>\n<div class=\"docbook_literallayout\"><pre>\nuntrusted_set_sender = ^$sender_ident-\n</pre></div>\n<p>\nIf you want to allow untrusted users to set envelope sender addresses without\nrestriction, you can use\n</p>\n<div class=\"docbook_literallayout\"><pre>\nuntrusted_set_sender = *\n</pre></div>\n<p>\nThe <span class=\"docbook_option\">untrusted_set_sender</span> option applies to all forms of local input, but\nonly to the setting of the envelope sender. It does not permit untrusted users\nto use the other options which trusted user can use to override message\nparameters. Furthermore, it does not stop Exim from removing an existing\n<span class=\"docbook_emphasis\">Sender:</span> header in the message, or from adding a <span class=\"docbook_emphasis\">Sender:</span> header if\nnecessary. <p>\n\nWhen a message is submitted locally (that is, not over a TCP/IP connection) by\nan untrusted user, Exim removes any existing <span class=\"docbook_emphasis\">Sender:</span> header line. If you\ndo not want this to happen, you must set <span class=\"docbook_option\">local_sender_retain</span>, and you must\nalso set <span class=\"docbook_option\">local_from_check</span> to be false (Exim will complain if you do not).\nSee also the ACL modifier <code class=\"docbook_literal\">control = suppress_local_fixups</code>.
