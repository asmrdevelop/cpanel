This library includes all the common reusable bits for cPanel and WHM frontend applications.

Dependencies:

    The hosting application must utilize a script similar the cjt2_header_include.tt to bring in the correct configuration.
    The library depends on the require.js package installed on cpanel and whm.

How to Integrate in an application:

    These files must be hosed in the docroot of the application under a directory called:

    libraries/cjt2

    and must be reachable via a url like:

    http:<server>:2087/libraries/cjt2/...
    http:<server>:2083/libraries/cjt2/...

Debugging:

    To use the debug mode code, you add the ?debug=1 flag to your url.

    Example:

    https://<server>:2087/script2/show_mod_security?debug=1/#hitlist

    To force it into non debug mode use either:

    https://<server>:2087/script2/show_mod_security/#hitlist
    https://<server>:2087/script2/show_mod_security?debug=0/#hitlist


Versions:

0.0.0.1 - Version released with the mysql preview build. Not intended for other uses.
0.0.0.2 - Version released with the mod security feature in WHM. Still a prototype, but now incorporated into the product.
