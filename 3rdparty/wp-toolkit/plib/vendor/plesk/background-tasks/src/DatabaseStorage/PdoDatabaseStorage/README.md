Simple PDO-based (https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) database storage implementation 
for background tasks data. It was checked with SQLite engine, but may work with other databases.
It lacks of proper error handling and has other limitations.

Use it for simple projects when you don't have another databases, 
or when you need to play around or develop background tasks library.
