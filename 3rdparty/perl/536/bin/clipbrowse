=head1 NAME

clipbrowse - Load a URL from the clipboard into your browser.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.28

=head1 USAGE

# ...copy something
# (You might want to do a `clipjoin` if the URL text is messy)
$ clipbrowse

Remember that many browsers will usefully load things that don't look like
URL's. For example Firefox does a Google "I'm feeling lucky" with non-URLs.
This means you can have any text in your clipboard and `clipbrowse`.

=head1 MOTIVATION

It saves a couple of seconds every time you run it.  Chrome and Firefox, for
examples, automatically create a new tab and loads the page when you invoke it
from the command line.  Already we've saved a Ctrl+T and a Shift+Insert.  When
you consider the parallelizing (that your browser will be actively loading the
page while you're Alt+Tabbing to it), you've squeaked out a little more.

Maybe I'm just a freak, but I like shaving out wasted time like that.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The environment variable C<$BROWSER> will override the default launching
command.  If you have a %s in the line, it will be replaced with the url.  if
not, the url will be appended at the end.

The default is `chromium-browser "%s"` (Debian's Google Chrome)
If you still use Firefox, consider: `firefox -remote "openURL(%s,new-tab)"'`.
