=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use POSIX::1003::Sysconf; # load all names

  use POSIX::1003::Sysconf qw(sysconf);
  # keys are strings!
  $ticks = sysconf('_SC_CLK_TCK');

  use POSIX::1003::Sysconf qw(sysconf _SC_CLK_TCK);
  $ticks  = _SC_CLK_TCK;   # constants are subs

  use POSIX::1003::Sysconf '%sysconf';
  my $key = $sysconf{_SC_CLK_TCK};
  $sysconf{_SC_NEW_KEY} = $key_code;
  $ticks  = sysconf($key);
