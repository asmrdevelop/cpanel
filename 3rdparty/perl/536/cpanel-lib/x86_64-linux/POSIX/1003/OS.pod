Get the name of current operating system.

 my ($sysname, $node, $release, $version, $machine) = uname();

Note that the actual meanings of the various fields are not
that well standardized: do not expect any great portability.
The C<$sysname> might be the name of the operating system, the
C<$nodename> might be the name of the host, the C<$release> might be
the (major) release number of the operating system, the
C<$version> might be the (minor) release number of the operating
system, and C<$machine> might be a hardware identifier.
Maybe.
