Enable DKIM/SPF Globally
/scripts/enabledkim
As of cPanel & WHM version 62, the system provisions SPF and DKIM
for new accounts by default. However, the system does not automatically
provision these DNS records for existing accounts. When you enable this
feature, the system will create SPF and DKIM DNS records for all accounts
and domains. If a domain currently possesses an SPF record, the system
will append the appropriate IP address from the /var/cpanel/mainip file
to the existing record. However, the system will not modify existing DKIM
records.

Do not edit any nameserver configuration files during this process.
