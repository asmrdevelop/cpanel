=head1 NAME

bin/setupdbmap - create directory for DB mapping

=head2 DESCRIPTION

B<setupdbmap> initializes the directory for DB map files (i.e., mapping
databases to their owners).

Prior to cPanel & WHM 11.44 this script also created the mapping files based on
database names; e.g., "frank_mydata" would be interpreted as "frank"â€™s database.
Since 11.44 removes any connection between a database's name and its owner's
name, all that is left for this script to do is to ensure that the directory for
the mapping files exists.
