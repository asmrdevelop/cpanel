 New locales should be added to the list in Cpanel::Locale

 by using the following to build the list
 ls /var/cpanel/locale |grep '.cdb$' | perl -pi -e 's/\.cdb$/ => 1,/g'

 If a new locale is not added it will still work
 however it will be much slower and use more memory

 ==> This list : my %known_locales;
