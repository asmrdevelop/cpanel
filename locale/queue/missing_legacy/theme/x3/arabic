EmailDKIMDesc: DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) is an e-mail authentication system that allows incoming mail to be checked against the server it was sent from to verify that the mail has not been modified. This ensures that messages are actually coming from the listed sender, and allows abusive messages to be tracked more easily.
