=head1 NAME

Whostmgr::Accounts::Remove::Cleanup::HordeMigration

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    Whostmgr::Accounts::Remove::Cleanup::HordeMigration::clean_up( $obj )

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Account removalâ€™s Horde Migration cleanup, because of course MySQL RoundCube
can't leave things in the user's home directory.

Don't ask me why there wasn't some kind of parent/implementor pattern here,
as that would make sense but is conspicuously missing.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 clean_up( $obj )

Removes data sitting around in /var/cpanel/userhomes/cpanelroundcube/$USER.
Normally this is just dumped ics/vcf data from scripts/export_*_to_*

Accepts HASHREF of data from L<Cpanel::Config::LoadCpUserData>.

Returns undef, as the caller never checks the return value anyways.

=cut

our $cprc_dir = '/var/cpanel/userhomes/cpanelroundcube';

# So, I use this below in cleanup because I need to know what directory
# I need to remove, but would prefer not to duplicate code to do this while
# I'm simultanelously wanting to know whether or not this code needs to run
# at all, as the negative condition is simply that the user or dir does not
# exist. As such I've renamed this sub from `skip_this` as it was to something
# entirely too descriptive for clarity's sake. Hope that helps.
# As a final NB, _horde_dir2kill is being stashed in the parent module for
# later consumption by cleanup (which is kinda grody, but whatever).
