    restore_mysql_for_account_restore [--help] --config-fd=<fd> --sql-fd=<fd>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<STOP!> This command is I<internal> to WHM. It is B<not> useful for manual
execution.

This program implements a MySQL restoration for WHM’s account-restore
system. It runs as a separate command rather than a simple Perl subprocess
due to mysterious, unsolved conflicts among various
L<zlib|https://www.zlib.net/> versions.

C<--config-fd> should be a file descriptor used for IPC between this
program and its parent process.

C<--sql-fd> is the L<mysqldump(1)> stream with the data we’ll restore.

Informational messages go to STDOUT. Warnings & errors go to STDERR.
Nonzero exit indicates failure.
