    process_ssl_pending_queue [ --help | --throttle=... ]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script processes the pending queue for SSL certificate
purchases. Once certificates become available, this script downloads
and installs them automatically.

This script usually runs from cron. Thus, you donâ€™t normally need to
run it manually. Nothing bad will happen if you do, though.

Options are:

=over

=item * C<--throttle> - Specifies how the pending-queue check logic
throttles requests. One of:

=over

=item * C<default> (default) - Skip certificate orders that were checked
recently. Under this option the script will poll for recent orders more
frequently than older orders.

=item * C<none> - Check all certificate orders, regardless of when the order
was last checked.

Most certificates are available quickly

=back

=item * C<--help> - Show this text.
