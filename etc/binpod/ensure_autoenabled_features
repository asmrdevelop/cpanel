=head1 NAME

bin/ensure_autoenabled_features

=head1 USAGE

This script is more to support auto enabling of features during the initial
install driven by C</scripts/cpanel_initial_install>. However, it can be run
via commandline as described below:

    ensure_autoenabled_features [--run | --list]

=head1 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

The script will not run if it is not passed either C<--run> or C<--list>. These
two flags are mutually exclusive.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item --run

Required argument to enable all qualifying C<Cpanel::Config::ConfigObj::Driver> modules.

=item --list

Makes no changes to the system, but merely
sends a list of all qualifying C<Cpanel::Config::ConfigObj::Driver> modules
to C<STDOUT>â€”i.e., those modules that B<would> be enabled if the C<--run>
flag were given.

=back

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This iterates over all C<Cpanel::Config::ConfigObj::Driver> modules, and if
it is set to be auto enabled (C<::META::auto_enable>) and is set to not show up in the
Feature Showcase (via C<::META::showcase>), then the Driver's C<enable> method is called.
