=head1 USAGE

build_apache_conf [--preview] [--nolock]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This script rebuilds Apache httpd’s main configuration file. Ordinarily
you shouldn’t need to run this manually because cPanel & WHM automatically
updates httpd’s configuration as needed.

Note that this does B<NOT> restart Apache httpd, but you’ll need to do that
in order for the new configuration file to take effect. To restart httpd,
run C</scripts/restartsrv_httpd>.

Options are:

=over

=item * C<--preview> - Creates a file named F<httpd-preview.conf> rather
than the standard F<httpd.conf>, which allows you to inspect the file
rather than having it be active right away.

=item * C<--nolock> - Ordinarily httpd.conf is locked while it is being
rebuilt to ensure that two processes don’t attempt the rebuild
concurrently. This flag suppresses that lock. You ordinarily should not
do this.

=back
