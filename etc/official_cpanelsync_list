# This is the official list of .cpanelsync files that are *ours* (cPanel's), and
# not 3rd party .cpanelsync files.
#
# This list was created June 2011 for scripts/find-immutable-files (q.v.). Only
# immutable files having entries in one of these files, that is, immutable files
# created, owned, and/or recognized by cPanel, are reported by that script.
#
# Relative paths are assumed relative to /usr/local/cpanel ;
#
# Note that one of the file names in the list is actually a wildcard for
# expansion. However, script find-immutable-files will expand it not in the
# usual way (a la the Perl glob() built-in), but in a very specialized, ad hoc
# manner.
