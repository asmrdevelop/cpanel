=head1 NAME

Cpanel::SPF::Test

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    my @missing = Cpanel::SPF::Test::find_missing_includes(
        'v=spf1 a mx +include:haha.com -all',
        'haha.com',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module contains logic for testing SPF strings.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

=head2 @missing_hosts = find_missing_includes( $SPF, @HOSTS )

Returns the members of @HOSTS that are not whitelisted via C<include>
in $SPF. (In scalar context this returns the number of such hosts.)

Right now this doesnâ€™t accommodate macros; we may need to beef up the
logic in the future.
