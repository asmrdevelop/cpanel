=head1 NAME

Cpanel::Update::IsCron - flag to record whether upcp is run from cron

=head1 DISCUSSION

It is sometimes useful for an external process to know whether upcp was
invoked from cron or manually. This flag facilitates that.

Note that this flagâ€™s being unset is indistinguishable from upcp not being
in progress.
