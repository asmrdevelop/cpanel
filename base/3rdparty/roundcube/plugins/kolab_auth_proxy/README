Proxy authentication for Kolab
------------------------------

This plugin adds ability for configured external app/user to impersonate
as another user in services based on Roundcube Framework.

Currently it works with Kolab iRony only, with one limitation - external file storages
are not accessible.

CONFIGURATION
-------------

1. In iRony config set:

    $config['kolabdav_plugins'] = array('kolab_auth_proxy', 'kolab_auth');

    Note: kolab_auth_proxy MUST be before kolab_auth.

2. In plugin config set:

    $config['kolab_auth_proxy_user']      = 'proxy';
    $config['kolab_auth_proxy_pass']      = '12345';
    $config['kolab_auth_proxy_imap_user'] = 'cyrus-admin';
    $config['kolab_auth_proxy_imap_pass'] = 'password';

After this you should be able to use *DAV services using HTTP basic authentication
with login: proxy**username and password: 12345, where "username" is the login of
the user you want to impersonate as.

Note that there are more options in config if you need working functionality
that involves accessing SMTP or LDAP.
